Stack for arbitrary data type
===
- Stack functionality without redundancy. 
   - Constructors: default, copy constructor and move constructor.
   - Assignment operator, including with move semantics. 
   - Modifiers required by the stack.
   - Observers, required by the stack.
   - Necessary methods providing access to the elements. 

- Specialization of template for bool type. It uses memory optimization (values are stored bit by bit).
