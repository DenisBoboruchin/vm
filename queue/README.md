2 queue implementations and one set of tests
===
- The first queue is implemented through a list
- The second queue is implemented through 2 stacks (it uses its own stack)
- The user interface is the same
- The test suite is the same for both queues
 Tests of both queues run in the same build.
- Google benchmarks are used.
